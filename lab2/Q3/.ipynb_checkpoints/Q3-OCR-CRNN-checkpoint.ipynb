    "- Input sequence is a sequence of image features and output is a sequence of characters\n",
    "- A word image's each column is treated as a timestep. so inputdim= height of the word image and seqlen= width of the image\n",
    "- Training images are rendered on the fly for the task\n",
    "- Images are resized to  fixed width , though we can have variying widths since RNN can handle variable length sequences. This helps in faster batch learning\n",
    "- We train a network with a bidirectional RNN  and a CTC loss for the task\n",
    "- To make sure the networks learns the mappings we first overfit it to 3 letter words\n",
    "- Then we will the train network on a larger dataset, comprising of images rendered from 90k English words\n",

    "In this first lab, to get familiar with RNNs, we will explore the simple problem of teaching an RNN to add binary strings. Recall, like grade-school addition, binary addition moves from the right-most bit (least-significant bit or LSB) towards the left-most bit (most-significant) bit, with a carry bit passed from the previous addition.\n",

    "__Question 2:__ [Challenge question] In the current setup, the model predicts a single `score`, and uses the squared-loss. In the lectures we saw using training RNNs to predict output probabilities for each category (=2 in our case, one for 0, and one for 1), and using softmax followed by cross-entropy as the loss function:\n",

    "Still, use affine (or linear) projection from hidden-state to output, but now regress to two \"scores\" (what should be dimensionality of `W_{hy}`?):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_t = W_{hy}h_t + b_{hy}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This output now should converted to \"probabilities\" using `softmax`, and then errors should be back-propagated using the cross-entropy loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_t^i = \\frac{\\exp(s_t^i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{j=2} \\exp(s_t^j)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the \"2\" in the above equation is for 2 scores -- corresponding to 0 and 1 respectively.\n",
    "The cross-entropy loss is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_t(y_t,\\tilde{y_t}) = - (1-\\tilde{y_t})\\log(s_t^1) - y_t\\log(s_t^2) $$\n",

    "__Note__ : Make sure you understand how this equation corresponds to what you saw in the lecture.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that the steps --- `softmax` followed by `cross-entropy` loss, first exponentiate and then take the log of the score. This is numerically unstable due to under/overflow (in the exponentiation). As this is a widely used operation, `PyTorch` combines these two steps in their [`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#crossentropyloss) function. So if we use this function, we do not have to explicitly use `softmax`.\n",

    "1. Modify the model to predict two output probabilities -- for 0 and 1 respectively at each time-step.\n",
    "2. Change the loss function from `nn.MSELoss` to `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`. Refer to the documentation of `nn.CrossEntropy` [here](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#crossentropyloss).\n",
    "3. Modify the \"testing\" code to get output from the model and verify that you are getting sensible outputs. \n",

    "1. In Q1 above, with the MSE loss, what was the minimum length of training bit-strings required to achieve perfect generalization?\n",
    "2. What is the minimum length of training bit-strings required to achieve perferct generalization on longer test bit-string, when using the new model trained using the CrossEntropy loss function? Explain why / why not it is different.\n",

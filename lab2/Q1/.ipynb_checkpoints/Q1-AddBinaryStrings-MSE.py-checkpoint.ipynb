    "In this first lab, to get familiar with RNNs, we will explore the simple problem of teaching an RNN to add binary strings. Recall, like grade-school addition, binary addition moves from the right-most bit (least-significant bit or LSB) towards the left-most bit (most-significant) bit, with a carry bit passed from the previous addition.\n",

This is numerically unstable due to under/overflow (in the exponentiation). As this is a widely used operation, `PyTorch` combines these two steps in their [`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#crossentropyloss) function. So if we use this function, we do not have to explicitly use `softmax`.\n",
